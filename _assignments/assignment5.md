This assignment covers the topics from week 6, which involve the use of statistical tools with just one variable.

The exercises may be challenging, but don't despair. Try to fill in the cells to the best of your ability. Attempts and mistakes also count towards points!

As a reminder, in order to work on and submit the assignment, you will need to follow these steps:

- Log in https://bunge.psy.cmu.edu with your Andrew ID as the username, and the password that you guys chose the first day.
- Go to the assignments tab.
- Click the "fetch" button next to the week-6 assignment.
- Now your assignment has been downloaded. Click on it and complete it.
- After its completion, go back to the Downloaded assignments and press "Submit".

In case of doubt on how to perform these steps, I recommend visiting the menu [materials](https://jrasero.github.io/cm-85309-2023-web/materials) in this  webpage, where you'll find a short video demonstrating how to do this.
