This assignment will test your knowledge of R and ggplot for visualization.

As a reminder, in order to be able to work on the assignment and submit it, you will need to do the following steps:

- Log in on the [server](https://bunge.psy.cmu.edu) with your Andrew ID as the username, and the password that you guys chose the first day.
- Go to the assignments tab.
- Press the "fetch" button.
- Now your assignment has been downloaded. Click on it and complete it.
- After its completion, go back to the Downloaded assignments and press "Submit".

In case of doubt on how to perform these steps, I recommend visiting the menu [materials](https://jrasero.github.io/cm-85309-2023-web/materials) in this  webpage, where you'll find a short video demonstration on how to fetch, download and submit assignments.
