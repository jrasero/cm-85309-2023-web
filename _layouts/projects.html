The final project will give you the opportunity to test the knowledge of what you have learned throughout the course on a real dataset. 

The project will involve outlining some main research question(s), carrying out some descriptive and inferential statistical analysis, regression modelling and a brief summary of your findings.

<b>IMPORTANT</b>: Any research question that you can pose as a statistical inference is fair.

You will have the choice of picking one of the following projects (Click in each link to know more details on the project):

--<ul id="archive">
{% for project in site.project %}
         
    <li class="archiveposturl" style="background: transparent">
        <span><a href="{{ project.url | prepend: site.baseurl}}" style="font-size: 20px;">{{ project.title }}</a></span>
      </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
