# HONOR CODE

You may not discuss this project in any way with anyone besides the professor and TA. Failure to abide by this policy will result in a grade equal to 0.

You can still of course ask general coding questions either on Piazza, via email or during office hours. But please don’t post a large block of code and then ask “why doesn’t this work?”

# TIPS

The project is an opportunity to apply what you guys have learned about descriptive and inferential statistics, regression modelling, and hypothesis testing.

The goal is NOT to do an exhaustive data analysis, that is do NOT try to calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable. Instead, try to show that you can efficiently use R to analyze data, and that you can interpret and present the results.

You might consider critiquing your own research, such as issues pertaining to the data and the appropriateness of the statistical analysis you used within the context of this project.
